-- Q. In a company there is only 1 entry allowed in a day. If a person gives different email id he/she can enter again. So, we need o find how many times
person visited the company, most visited floor and what resources he/she used ?

-- STep 1 : We will check which person visited which floor how many times.

SELECT name, floor, COUNT(1) AS no_of_times_floor_visit
FROM entries
GROUP BY name, floor;

-- Step 2 : Adding rank function to the floor visit

SELECT name, floor, COUNT(1) AS no_of_times_floor_visit
, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY name ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rn
FROM entries
GROUP BY name, floor;

-- STep 3 : Putting above Query in CTE to get most visited floor

WITH floor_visit 
AS
(
SELECT name, floor, COUNT(1) AS no_of_times_floor_visit
, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY name ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC) AS rn
FROM entries
GROUP BY name, floor
)
SELECT fv.name, fv.floor
FROM floor_visit AS fv
WHERE rn = 1;

-- Step 4 : Find the total number of visits by each person and resources used by them

SELECT name, COUNT(1) AS total_visits, STRING_AGG(resources , ',') AS resources_used
FROM entries
GROUP BY name;

-- STep 5 : Combining both the queries.
