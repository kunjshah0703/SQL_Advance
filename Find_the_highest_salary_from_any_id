-- Q. We need to find the salary of all employees where their salary is greater than salary of 2nd person.

-- Step 1 : We will create Employee and salary table.

CREATE TABLE Employee
(
emp_id int,
emp_name varchar(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Salary
(
emp_id int,
emp_salary int
);

-- Step 2 : We will insert values in both tables

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES
(1, 'Kunj'),
(2, 'Vikrant'),
(3, 'Aditya'),
(4, 'Ravi'),
(5, 'Rahul'),
(6, 'Vikas');

INSERT INTO Salary VALUES
(1, 27000),
(2, 25000),
(3, 20000),
(4, 24000),
(5, 30000),
(6, 25500);

-- Step 3 : 
-- We need to use subquery as well as CTE in this

WITH high_salary
AS
(
SELECT *
FROM Employee AS e
INNER JOIN Salary As s
ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
)
SELECT emp_name, emp_salary
FROM high_salary
WHERE emp_salary > (SELECT emp_salary
                    FROM Salary WHERE emp_id = 2);
