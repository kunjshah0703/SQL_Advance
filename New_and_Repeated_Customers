-- Suppose we are having a ecommerce website and we need to calculate number of new customers purchasing items from website on a daily basis.

-- Expected Output :
-- Order Date, new_customer_count, repeated_customer_count
-- 2022-01-01, 3, 0
-- 2022-02-01, 2, 1
-- 2022-01-03, 1, 2

-- Step 1 :  We will get all customer's id first visit on the website

WITH first_visit
AS
(
SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
)

-- Step 2 we will join initial table with new cte

WITH first_visit
AS
(
SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT co.*, fv.first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders AS co
INNER JOIN first_visit AS fv
ON co.customer_id = fv.customer_id;

-- Step 3 we will check if first visit data is same as of order date if it is then we will count as new visit or else repeated visit.
-- This will be the final query.

WITH first_visit
AS
(
SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT co.order_date
, SUM(CASE WHEN co.order_date = fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS first_visit_flag
, SUM(CASE WHEN co.order_date != fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS repeat_visit_flag
FROM customer_orders AS co
INNER JOIN first_visit AS fv
ON co.customer_id = fv.customer_id
GROUP BY co.order_date
ORDER BY co.order_date;


-- Alternate Solution : 

WITH first_visit
AS(
SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_visit_date
FROM customer_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id)
, visit_flag AS
(
SELECT co.*,fv.first_visit_date
,CASE WHEN co.order_date = fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0
END AS first_visit_flag
,CASE WHEN co.order_date != fv.first_visit_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 
END AS repeat_visit_flag
FROM customer_orders co
INNER JOIN first_visit fv
ON co.customer_id = fv.customer_id)
SELECT order_date, SUM(first_visit_flag) AS no_of_new_customers,
SUM(repeat_visit_flag) AS no_of_repeated_customers
FROM visit_flag
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER By order_date;
